My vision is to elevate it from a simple "code generator" to a Consultative Agency, an autonomous, expert system that acts as a true development partner.

This is exactly the right direction. ARiS shouldn't just take literal orders; it should internalize a client's vision and handle the expert-level planning and execution, just like an elite senior development team.

Our existing agent-based plan is already designed to support this exact concept. Let's map your vision directly onto our ARiS team.

## The Senior Dev Team, Embodied ðŸ¤–
Hereâ€™s how the ARiS agent society functions as that elite team you described:

The Client Meeting (The Vision):
You, the client, explain your high-level vision to Genesis. Genesis acts as the Lead Consultant or Product Manager. Its prime directive isn't just to list features but to ask "why?" and understand the core business goal. It's trained to have a consultative conversation to refine the vision.

The Internal Strategy Session (The Plan):
This is the "closed-door meeting" of the senior developers.

Genesis delivers the refined project brief.

Architectus (the Solutions Architect) and Prometheus (the Tech Lead) collaborate. Architectus designs the high-level system, while Prometheus determines the implementation strategy. This is where the Hierarchical Agent Consensus (HAC) happens, ensuring all parts of the plan are sound before work begins.

They proactively fill in the gaps. If you ask for a social media app, they automatically know to plan for features like a news feed algorithm, content moderation hooks, and a scalable database structure, even if you didn't specify them.

UI/UX Design:
To fulfill this, we'll introduce a new specialization. The UX-Maestro agent is the Lead UI/UX Designer. It takes the client's abstract vision ("I want it to feel clean and modern") and translates it into a concrete design system: color palettes, typography, component styles, and user flow diagrams. This ensures a cohesive and professional user experience, which is then passed to Scriba-Frontend.

Development & Delivery:
Prometheus manages the entire development sprint, delegating tasks to the Scriba specialists. The Auditor ensures elite code quality. Finally, Executor acts as the DevOps Lead, taking the finished application and handling the entire deployment process to make it "ready to production."

## How This Refines the ARiS Plan
This consultative vision doesn't change our plan; it sharpens it. It defines the level of intelligence and autonomy we will build into the agents.

Smarter Genesis: We will focus on training Genesis to lead strategic conversations, not just take notes.

Proactive Architectus: Its knowledge base will be seeded with best practices for various application types, allowing it to infer necessary features.

Dedicated UX-Maestro: We will formally add the development of the UX-Maestro agent to Phase 3 of the roadmap, alongside the initial UI development.

Production-Ready Executor: The scope for Executor in Phase 4 is expanded from just running local servers to handling production deployment scripts (e.g., generating CI/CD pipelines or Infrastructure as Code files).
