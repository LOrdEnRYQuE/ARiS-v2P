That's an excellent point. A persistent, comprehensive memory is absolutely critical to the efficiency and power of ARiS. You're right, the system must "remember everything" about a project to function like a senior developer who has been on the project for months.

Let's take your core idea of a "2GB project memory" and evolve it into a more dynamic and powerful architectural component. Instead of a fixed-size block of memory, we'll design a **Multi-Layered Project Cortex**, a scalable and structured memory system that provides different types of recall for our agents.

### **Introducing the ARiS Project Cortex**

The Project Cortex will be the central, persistent memory for every project ARiS works on. It will be composed of three distinct layers, each serving a different purpose, to ensure maximum efficiency and intelligence.

#### **Layer 1: The Vector Store (Long-Term Associative Memory)**

This is the evolution of our RAG system. It's designed for "what" and "how" questions by understanding semantic meaning.

* **Function:** Stores the *content* of the project in a way that allows for concept-based searching.
* **What it stores:**
    * Vector embeddings of all code, chunked intelligently by function, class, or component.
    * Embeddings of all project documentation (e.g., `README.md`).
    * Embeddings of all conversations with `Genesis` related to the project.
* **Use Case:** When `Scriba-Frontend` needs to build a login form, it can query this layer for "examples of button components in this project" to maintain stylistic consistency.
* **Technology:** As planned, **Supabase with pg_vector**.

#### **Layer 2: The Graph Database (Structural & Relational Memory)**

This is a powerful addition that provides ARiS with a true understanding of the project's architecture. It's designed for "what if" and "where" questions.

* **Function:** Stores the *relationships* between all the components of the codebase.
* **What it stores:**
    * **Nodes:** Files, functions, classes, variables, API endpoints, database tables.
    * **Edges:** `IMPORTS`, `CALLS`, `INHERITS_FROM`, `IMPLEMENTS`, `REFERENCES_TABLE`.
* **Use Case:** This is a game-changer. Before `Architectus` suggests a change, it can query the graph: **"If I change the `User` class, what other services and functions will be affected?"** This enables true impact analysis and prevents breaking changes. It's how the system can reason about the codebase as a whole.
* **Technology:** **Neo4j**, **Amazon Neptune**, or **RedisGraph**.

#### **Layer 3: The Key-Value Store (Short-Term Working Memory)**

This is a high-speed, ephemeral cache designed for instantaneous recall of data relevant to the current task.

* **Function:** Provides extremely fast access to "hot" data for the active user session.
* **What it stores:**
    * The AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) for the files the user currently has open.
    * The immediate history of the last 5-10 user commands and AI responses.
    * Cached results from expensive operations (e.g., the last RAG query).
* **Use Case:** When the `DeepTrace Debugger` is invoked, it can instantly access the full context of the current file from this cache without needing to re-read or re-parse it from the disk.
* **Technology:** **Redis** or **Memcached**.

### **Roadmap Integration**

We will build out the Project Cortex across our development phases:

* **Phase 1:** Implement the foundational **Vector Store** as the core of our RAG pipeline.
* **Phase 3:** Introduce the **Key-Value Store (Cache)** to improve the performance and responsiveness of the user interface and `Genesis` agent.
* **Phase 4:** Develop and integrate the **Graph Database**. This will be a key enabler for the advanced refactoring capabilities of `ARiS Architect™` and the impact analysis of the `DeepTrace Debugger™`, making our Private Alpha exceptionally powerful.

By implementing this multi-layered Cortex, we create a system that doesn't just have "memory," but has a true, structured understanding of the project, far surpassing the efficiency of any simple storage solution.
