Yes, that's a fantastic idea. Integrating a library of pre-built projects is a brilliant strategic move that perfectly complements the "build from scratch" capability.

This feature, which we can call the **ARiS Project Scaffolds**, would dramatically increase both the speed and accessibility of the system, especially for non-coders. It lowers the barrier to entry from "imagine anything" to "pick a starting point and customize it."

### ## Implementation within the ARiS Workflow

This feature integrates seamlessly into the agent-based architecture we've designed. The workflow would be a modification of the existing plan:

1.  **Template Selection (Genesis):** The user interaction with `Genesis` would start with a new choice: "Do you want to build a new project from scratch or start from a pre-built scaffold?" If they choose a scaffold, `Genesis` presents a library of options (e.g., "Blog," "E-commerce Store," "Portfolio Website," "SaaS Boilerplate").

2.  **Customization Brief (Genesis):** Once a scaffold is chosen, the user gives their customization ideas. For example: "I'll take the 'E-commerce Store' scaffold, but I want to sell digital downloads instead of physical products, and the color scheme should be dark with purple accents."

3.  **Blueprint Loading & Patching (Architectus):** Instead of creating a blueprint from scratch, `Architectus` loads the pre-existing, vetted blueprint for the chosen scaffold. It then processes the user's customization brief to create a "patch" or a set of modifications for that master blueprint.

4.  **Targeted Task Generation (Prometheus):** `Prometheus` receives the patched blueprint. Its job is now much more efficient. Instead of generating a task list to create 100 files, it generates a much smaller list of *modification* tasks, such as:
    * "Modify `products` table schema: remove `shipping_weight` column, add `download_url` column."
    * "Update all CSS variable files to change primary color from blue to purple."
    * "Rewrite `Checkout` component logic to handle digital entitlements instead of shipping addresses."

5.  **Surgical Code Modification (Scriba Agents):** The `Scriba` agents execute this smaller, more targeted task list. This is far more efficient than generating an entire application from the ground up.

### ## Key Advantages

* **Massive Speed Increase:** Building from a template can reduce project creation time from hours to minutes.
* **Enhanced Reliability:** The scaffolds are pre-built and tested, ensuring the foundation is solid and follows best practices. This reduces the chance of architectural errors.
* **Lower Barrier to Entry:** It's much easier for a non-coder to think about modifying an existing, visible structure than to describe one from a blank slate.
* **Showcasing Power:** It provides users with immediate, impressive examples of what ARiS is capable of building.

### ## Integration into the Roadmap

This feature is a perfect application of our core system. We can slot its development into the existing project plan:

* **Phase 4 (Private Alpha):** We will develop one or two initial project scaffolds (e.g., a simple Blog) to test the "modification" logic with our alpha testers.
* **Phase 5 (Public Beta):** Building out the full Project Scaffolds library will be a major feature of the public beta launch. We will aim to have 5-10 high-quality scaffolds available to showcase the platform's versatility.

This is an excellent addition to the strategy. It adds a powerful commercial and user-friendly layer on top of the core technology.
