This document outlines the development plan for ARiS, a multi-agent system designed to revolutionize software development from within VS Code.

Project Plan: ARiS (Agentic Reactive Intelligence System)
Project Name: ARiS

Acronym: Agentic Reactive Intelligence System

Vision: To create a digital software house within the developer's editor, capable of understanding high-level user goals and translating them into stable, modern, and complete software projects.

Start Date: August 1, 2025

Location: Landshut, Bavaria, Germany

Core Guiding Principles
Security First: No action that affects a user's file system or executes code will ever occur without explicit, human-in-the-loop confirmation.

Modularity & Specialization: The multi-agent architecture is paramount. Each agent will be an expert in its narrow domain.

Transparency: The user should be able to inspect the plan and actions of the agent system at any time.

Progressive Complexity: We will build and release capabilities in logical phases, ensuring a stable foundation before adding complexity.

High-Level Phased Rollout
This project is broken down into five primary phases, spanning approximately 15 months to a Public Beta release.

Phase 0: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (Q3 2025)
Timeline: August 2025 – September 2025

Objective: To set up the complete development environment and create a "tracer bullet" prototype that proves the end-to-end communication path between all core components.

Key Milestones:

Repository Setup: Initialize the monorepo using Turborepo.

Cloud Infrastructure: Configure Vercel for serverless deployment and Supabase for the database.

Basic Extension & LSP: Create a minimal VS Code extension that successfully starts and communicates with a local Language Server (LSP).

"Hello, Agent": The LSP successfully calls a single, simple serverless function (a precursor to our agents) on Vercel, which returns a response. This validates the entire communication chain.

Phase 1: The Architect & The Scribe (Q4 2025)
Timeline: October 2025 – December 2025

Objective: To build the first intelligent agents capable of designing a software blueprint and writing the initial code based on it.

Key Milestones:

Agent Architectus v1: Develop the Solutions Architect agent. It can take a structured JSON brief and output a detailed technical blueprint (file structure, API contracts, DB schema).

Agent Scriba-Backend v1: Develop the first specialist code-writing agent. It can take a single task from the blueprint (e.g., "create user model") and generate the corresponding code file.

Tree-sitter Integration: The LSP now uses Tree-sitter to parse and understand the code structurally (ASTs).

End-to-End Test: A developer can manually craft a JSON brief, and the system will generate the code for a simple, single-endpoint Node.js/Express application.

Phase 2: The Orchestrator & The Auditor (Q1 2026)
Timeline: January 2026 – March 2026

Objective: To introduce project management and quality control, enabling the system to build multi-file projects autonomously.

Key Milestones:

Agent Prometheus v1: Develop the Project Manager agent. It can take a full blueprint from Architectus, create a dependency graph of tasks, and dispatch them to the Scriba agent(s) in the correct order.

Agent Auditor v1: Develop the QA agent. It can review generated code for basic syntax errors and adherence to the blueprint.

First Multi-File Project: The system can now autonomously generate a simple full-stack project (e.g., a "To-Do" app backend) with multiple files and modules, orchestrated by Prometheus and checked by Auditor.

Phase 3: The User Interface & Frontend Specialist (Q2 2026)
Timeline: April 2026 – June 2026

Objective: To build the user-facing components, allowing for natural language interaction for the first time.

Key Milestones:

VS Code UI: Develop the chat and wizard interface within the VS Code WebView.

Agent Genesis v1: Develop the Product Manager agent. It can take a simple, natural language request from the chat UI and translate it into the structured brief that Architectus understands.

Agent Scriba-Frontend v1: Develop the frontend specialist agent.

First User-Driven E2E Flow: A user can type "Create a React component for a login button" into the VS Code extension, and ARiS will generate and save the corresponding .tsx file.

Phase 4: Full Execution & Private Alpha (Q3 2026)
Timeline: July 2026 – September 2026

Objective: To enable the system to execute commands and manage a project's lifecycle, and to begin testing with a small group of trusted users.

Key Milestones:

Agent Executor v1: Develop the DevOps agent with its non-negotiable security confirmation layer.

Full System Integration: All agents (Genesis, Architectus, Prometheus, Scriba, Auditor, Executor) are working in concert.

Private Alpha Launch: Onboard 5-10 developers to test the system.

"Zero to Running" Test: A user can issue a high-level command like "Create a simple blog application," and ARiS will generate the code, install dependencies (npm install), and (with permission) run the local development server.

Phase 5: Public Beta & Expansion (Q4 2026 and beyond)
Timeline: Starting October 2026

Objective: To open ARiS to a wider audience and begin expanding its capabilities based on user feedback.

Key Milestones:

Launch the Public Beta.

Implement robust feedback collection mechanisms.

Begin development of new specialist agents (e.g., Scriba-Mobile, Scriba-Python, Structor-CloudFormation).

Refine the Wizard Mode for non-coders based on real-world usage.

Risk Assessment & Mitigation
Technical Risk: LLM "hallucinations" or low-quality code generation.

Mitigation: The Auditor agent is our primary defense. We will also employ techniques like few-shot prompting and fine-tuning specialized models for each Scriba.

Financial Risk: High cost of API calls to powerful LLMs during development and operation.

Mitigation: Aggressive caching of results. Use smaller, cheaper models for simpler tasks (e.g., a local Code Llama for syntax checks by Auditor). Strict budget monitoring via cloud provider alerts.

Security Risk: The Executor agent running malicious or destructive commands.

Mitigation: This is the highest priority risk. The security layer will be non-negotiable: every command must be displayed in a human-readable format and require an explicit click-to-approve from the user for every single execution.
