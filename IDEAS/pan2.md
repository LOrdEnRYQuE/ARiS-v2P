Alright, the project plan is set. Let's move immediately into execution. We'll adopt an agile methodology, working in focused sprints.

Here is the plan for our first sprint.

-----

### **ARiS: Sprint 1 Plan**

  * **Sprint Name:** "The Tracer Bullet"
  * **Duration:** 2 Weeks (August 1, 2025 â€“ August 15, 2025)
  * **Sprint Goal:** To achieve the "Hello, Agent" milestone defined in Phase 0. We will build a complete, end-to-end communication path from the VS Code extension to the serverless backend and back. This proves the core architecture is viable before we write any complex AI logic.

#### **Key Tasks & Objectives:**

1.  **Setup Monorepo:**

      * Initialize a new project using **Turborepo**.
      * Create three initial package directories within the monorepo: `apps/extension`, `packages/lsp`, and `apps/backend`.

2.  **Build the Extension Client (`apps/extension`):**

      * Use `yo code` to generate a basic TypeScript extension inside this directory.
      * Implement a single VS Code command (e.g., `aris.helloAgent`).
      * This command's only job will be to start the Language Server client and send it a simple message.

3.  **Build the Language Server (`packages/lsp`):**

      * Set up a new TypeScript package for our Language Server.
      * Write the logic to receive the message from the extension client.
      * Upon receiving the message, the LSP will make an HTTP `fetch` call to our serverless backend endpoint.
      * It will then wait for the response and log it to the VS Code output channel.

4.  **Create the Serverless Backend (`apps/backend`):**

      * Initialize a minimal **Next.js** application inside this directory.
      * Create a single API route (e.g., `/api/hello`).
      * This route will simply return a hardcoded JSON response:
        ```json
        { "message": "Hello from your ARiS agent! System is online." }
        ```

#### **Definition of "Done"**

This sprint is considered successful when we can:

1.  Run the VS Code extension in debug mode.
2.  Trigger the `aris.helloAgent` command from the command palette.
3.  See the message `"Hello from your ARiS agent! System is online."` printed in the VS Code output channel.

This demonstrates that our extension client, language server, and serverless backend are all communicating correctly. It's the skeleton upon which we will build everything else.

Let's begin with the first task: setting up the Turborepo monorepo.
