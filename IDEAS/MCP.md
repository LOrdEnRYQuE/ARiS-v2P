Of course. While "MCP server" isn't a standard industry term, in the context of a sophisticated AI system like ARiS, it points toward a crucial component for managing and controlling the entire operation. I believe you're envisioning a **Model Control Plane** for managing our AI models, and a **Mission Control Panel** for observing the agents.

Let's integrate both concepts, as they are essential for a professional, production-ready system.

### ## 1. The Model Control Plane: The "AI Factory"

This is the backend system responsible for the entire lifecycle of our fine-tuned AI models. It's the MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) engine that ensures our specialized agents (`Scriba-React-tuned`, etc.) are always improving.

* **Core Function:** To automate the testing, deployment, and monitoring of our fine-tuned models.
* **Key Features:**
    * **Model Registry:** A central place to store all versions of our fine-tuned models.
    * **A/B Testing:** When we create a new version of `Scriba-Backend`, the Control Plane can deploy it alongside the old one, routing (for example) 10% of requests to the new model to compare its performance in a live environment.
    * **Performance Monitoring:** It constantly watches for "model drift," where a model's performance degrades over time, and alerts us.
    * **Automated Retraining:** It can be configured to automatically trigger a new fine-tuning job when enough new high-quality training data has been collected by ARiS.
* **Suggested Technology:** We don't need to build this from scratch. We can use industry-standard MLOps platforms like **MLflow**, **Kubeflow**, or managed services like **Amazon SageMaker** or **Google Vertex AI**.
* **Integration into Roadmap:** This is an advanced capability. We would begin its implementation in **Phase 5 (Public Beta & Expansion)**, once we have a critical mass of fine-tuned models that require systematic management.

### ## 2. The Mission Control Panel: The "Operations Dashboard"

This is a high-level, real-time dashboard for us—the developers of ARiS—to monitor the health and activity of the entire agent society. It's our window into the system's brain.

* **Core Function:** To provide observability and insights into the ARiS system as it works on user projects.
* **What it would display:**
    * **Live Agent Graph:** A visual representation of which agents (`Genesis`, `Prometheus`, `Scriba`s) are currently active on a given project.
    * **Task Queue Status:** A real-time view of `Prometheus`'s task list, showing what's pending, in progress, and completed.
    * **Resource Monitoring:** Live charts showing API costs, model latency, and token usage.
    * **Quality Metrics:** A dashboard for `Auditor`'s performance, showing its success rate, common error types it flags, and the number of self-correction loops required for tasks.
* **Suggested Technology:** This would be a dedicated web application within our Turborepo. We could use **Next.js** for the frontend and powerful data visualization libraries. For collecting and displaying the metrics, we could integrate tools like **Prometheus** (the monitoring system) and **Grafana**.
* **Integration into Roadmap:** We'll start building a very basic version of this for our own debugging purposes in **Phase 2**. It will be built out into a comprehensive dashboard in **Phase 4** to support the Private Alpha, allowing us to monitor how our first users are interacting with the system.

By implementing both a **Model Control Plane** for our AI assets and a **Mission Control Panel** for observability, we ensure that ARiS is not only powerful but also manageable, scalable, and reliable.
