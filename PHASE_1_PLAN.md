## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### LLM Service Architecture
```typescript
interface LLMService {
  generateBlueprint(requirements: string): Promise<Blueprint>;
  generateCode(blueprint: Blueprint, file: File): Promise<string>;
  analyzeCode(code: string): Promise<CodeAnalysis>;
}
```

### Agent Enhancement Pattern
```typescript
class EnhancedAgent extends BaseAgent {
  private llmService: LLMService;
  
  async processTask(task: Task): Promise<Result<any>> {
    const llmResponse = await this.llmService.process(task);
    return this.handleLLMResponse(llmResponse);
  }
}
```

### Tree-sitter Integration
```typescript
interface CodeAnalyzer {
  parseAST(code: string): AST;
  analyzeStructure(ast: AST): CodeStructure;
  detectPatterns(ast: AST): Pattern[];
}
```
