## 🏗️ Technical Architecture Enhanced

### New AST Package (`packages/ast`)

```typescript
// AST Analysis Pipeline
ASTAnalyzer -> SimpleParser -> Code Analysis -> Quality Assessment -> Report Generation

class ASTAnalyzer {
  async analyzeFile(file: File): Promise<ASTAnalysis> {
    const ast = this.parser.parseFile(file);
    const functions = this.analyzeFunctions(ast);
    const classes = this.analyzeClasses(ast);
    const metrics = this.calculateMetrics(ast);
    const quality = this.analyzeQuality(ast, metrics);
    return { file, functions, classes, metrics, quality };
  }
}
```

### Enhanced AuditorAgent

```typescript
class AuditorAgent extends BaseAgent {
  private analyzer: ASTAnalyzer;

  async processTask(task: Task): Promise<Result<any>> {
    const file = this.extractFileFromTask(task);
    const analysis = await this.analyzer.analyzeFile(file);
    const auditReport = this.generateAuditReport(analysis);
    return { success: true, data: { auditReport, analysis } };
  }
}
```
