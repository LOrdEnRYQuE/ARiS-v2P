## 🏗️ Technical Architecture Enhanced

### Real-Time Analysis System

```typescript
// Real-time analysis pipeline
Document Change → Debounced Analysis → AST Analysis → Quality Assessment → Visual Feedback

class RealTimeAnalyzer {
  private debouncedAnalysis: (editor: TextEditor) => void;
  private qualityDecorations: QualityDecorations;

  async performRealTimeAnalysis(editor: TextEditor): Promise<void> {
    const file = this.createFileObject(editor.document);
    const analysis = await this.astAnalyzer.analyzeFile(file);
    this.applyQualityDecorations(editor, analysis);
    this.showInlineSuggestions(editor, analysis);
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Agent Coordination

```typescript
// Multi-agent coordination system
Genesis → Prometheus → Architectus → Scriba → Auditor → Executor

class AgentCoordinator {
  async executeMultiAgentWorkflow(requirements: string): Promise<WorkflowResult> {
    const genesisResult = await this.genesis.analyzeRequirements(requirements);
    const prometheusResult = await this.prometheus.createProject(genesisResult);
    const architectusResult = await this.architectus.generateBlueprint(prometheusResult);
    const scribaResult = await this.scriba.generateCode(architectusResult);
    const auditorResult = await this.auditor.reviewCode(scribaResult);
    const executorResult = await this.executor.setupEnvironment(auditorResult);
    return executorResult;
  }
}
```
